## Problem
How does one predict sales for a game based on genre, publisher, and platform?

## Things to Note
* All game sales are in millions
* A bad game is defined as sales under 5 million
* A good game is defined as sales 5 million < 10 million
* A best seller is defined as sales over 10 million
* All data after 2015 was droped due to the data being pulled in Oct 2016

## Information Breakdown
1. Use file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)
2. Import data and verify it's correct
3. System statistic breakdowns
  * XBox
  * XBox 360
